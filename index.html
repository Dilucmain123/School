          gates of Hades shall not prevail against it” (Matthew 16:18). Plus, the church is how God is accomplishing His
          work on earth today.</p>

      <p>Environmental pollution is one of the critical issues for humanity. It is becoming a threat to life on earth.
        With the increase in pollution, living beings are less likely to live the healthy life that they used to live
        earlier. A lot of deadly diseases occur just because of environmental pollution. This problem is becoming
        critical day by day. Because of this speech we won.</p>

        canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of
        the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right
        nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen
        Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may
        have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling,
        making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management System:
      This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the
      school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the
      students’ absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can
      later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to
      their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum’s subjects. As soon
      as you enter a student’s Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended
      will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security
      offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans
